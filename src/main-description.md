# The Metanomic API Specification

This is the API server for the Metanomic Economy Engine.
You can find out more about Metanomic at [http://metanomic.net](http://metanomic.net).
You will need a set of Account API Keys to test the entrypoints.

The goal of this specification is to define a standard,
language-agnostic interface for API clients of the platform.
We want you to:

- be able to discover and understand the capabilities
  of the service without access to source

- follow the the documentation to define the requirements of integrating with Metanomic

- understand and interact with our remote services with a minimal amount of
  implementation logic.

## Concepts of Entities

The Metanomic platform introduces a set of proprietary economic and classification algorithms based in probabilistic and deep-learning models that are capable of managing a large, complex virtual economy, with both fiscal and monetary components; game-design concepts; governance; a marketplace; a player Wallet and identity system. These link together and integrate under one unified API (the current API), in order to create a customisable end-to-end gaming economy platform.
